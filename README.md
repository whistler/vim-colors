The first colorsheme I made, only works in terminal. Dark background with bright white, blue and lime.

A blue/green color scheme, I lost the original version in a mishap, I am writing it again using an amazing
ruby gem called pallete, it might turn out to be a little different but this time i'm saving it on github 
so I dont lose it again. Perhaps others might like it too.
